# Co-Coding Test Practice Repository

## 🚀 Goals

This repository is a space for practicing coding tests together.
We collaborate with teammates to solve various problems and improve our skills through feedback.

## 🖥️ Language

JavaScript

## 👥 Participants

- Sienna [GitHub](https://github.com/sgoldenbird)
- Adrian [GitHub](https://github.com/AdutP)
- Rafi [GitHub](https://github.com//rafi-isakh)

## 🤝 Collaboration Rules

- Each participant will create their own branch and code individually. Example: sienna
- Submit a PR to the main branch by **Friday** each week.
- Merging will occur every Saturday.
- We will provide feedback to each other through code reviews and issues.
- We will solve 3~4 problems per week. (Adjustments will be made if the difficulty increases.)
- If you encounter difficult problems, create an issue using **the question issue template** to ask questions and share solutions.
- Refer to **[the milestones](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/milestones)** for the specific progress.

## 🤝 Commit Rules

- Commit after solving each problem
- Refer to the table below for writing commit messages
