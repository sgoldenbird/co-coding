# Co-Coding Test Practice Repository

## üöÄ Goals

This repository is a space for practicing coding tests together.
We collaborate with teammates to solve various problems and improve our skills through feedback.

## üñ•Ô∏è Language

JavaScript

## üë• Participants

- Sienna [GitHub](https://github.com/sgoldenbird)
- Adrian [GitHub](https://github.com/AdutP)
- Rafi [GitHub](https://github.com//rafi-isakh)

## ü§ù Collaboration Rules

- Each participant will create their own branch with their name and code individually.
- We will solve 3~4 problems per week. (Adjustments will be made if the difficulty increases.)
- We will provide feedback to each other through code reviews and issues.
- We will maintain the repo by taking turns(Sienna -> Adrian -> Rafi)
- Refer to **[the milestones](https://github.com/sgoldenbird/co-coding/milestones)** for the specific progress.
- Refer to **[co-coding roadmap](https://github.com/users/sgoldenbird/projects/2)** for the overall progress.

### ü§ù PR Rules

- Submit a PR to the main branch by **Friday** each week.
- Merge every Saturday.

### ü§ù Issue Rules

- If you encounter difficult problems, create an issue using **the question issue template** to ask questions and share solutions.
- Label a category of a problem (e.g. `array` `string`)
- Label a level of a problem (e.g. `easy` `medium`)
- Label a source of a problem (e.g. `LeetCode` `LeetCode75`)

### ü§ù Commit Rules

- Commit after solving each problem.
- Refer to the table below for writing commit messages.

| Commit Type | Description                                          | Example Message                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `solve:`    | Used when solving a problem                          | `solve: merge strings alternately`                                |
| `fix:`      | Used when fixing a bug                               | `fix: correct logic for checking the greatest common divisor`     |
| `optimize:` | Used for optimizing code (no functional changes)     | `optimize: simplify the algorithm for finding the common divisor` |
| `note:`     | Used when adding some notes                          | `note: add explanation for 'merge strings alternately' solution`  |
| `docs:`     | Used when updating documentation (e.g., README)      | `docs: update README with explanation for new problem solution`   |
| `chore:`    | Used for other changes (e.g., updating dependencies) | `chore: update package dependencies`                              |
